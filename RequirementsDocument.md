# 1. Introduction

This section serves as the documentation to the Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document for the "Online Faculty Research Connection Platform"

## 1.1 Document Purpose
The purpose of this SRS document is to clearly define the requirements and specifications for the development of the "Online Faculty-Student Research Connection Platform." It outlines the non-functional requirements that the software solution must meet. This document serves as a critical reference for the project's stakeholders, including the development team, quality assurance, and all relevant parties involved in the platform's creation and operation.
## 1.2 Product Scope
### 1.2.1 Product Description
The "Online Faculty-Student Research Connection Platform" is designed to address the need for a centralized online platform where faculty members can post research positions and seamlessly connect with qualified undergraduate students. This platform will facilitate efficient communication between faculty and students, promoting collaborative research opportunities within the academic community.

### 1.2.2 Purpose and Goals
The main purpose of this software product is to offer an intuitive and user-friendly online interface that enables students to submit their contact information, academic coursework details, research interests, and prior research experience. Faculty members will have the ability to advertise research opportunities, receive student applications, and select candidates for interviews. 

The key objectives and goals of the platform include:
- Enhancing the accessibility of research opportunities for undergraduate students.
- Streamlining the faculty's ability to find and select qualified student researchers.
- Improving the overall efficiency and transparency of the research matching process.

### 1.2.3 Benefits
The "Online Faculty-Student Research Connection Platform" offers several benefits, including:
- Facilitating collaboration and networking between faculty and students.
- Simplifying the application and selection process for research positions.
- Enhancing the academic and research experience for all users.

## 1.3 Document Overview
The remainder of this document is organized into the following sections:


- Section 2: Non-Functional Requirements - Outlines performance, security, and usability criteria.
- Section 3: User Interface (UI) Design - Details the design and user interface guidelines.
- Section 4: Data Management - Specifies data storage and management requirements.
- Section 5: System Architecture - Provides a high-level overview of the platform's architecture.
- Section 6: Use Cases and User Scenarios - Presents detailed use cases to illustrate real-world interactions.
- Section 7: Assumptions and Constraints - Lists any assumptions and constraints that guide the development.
- Section 8: Traceability Matrix - Links requirements to their sources and provides a history of revisions.
- Section 9: Change Control and Version History - Explains the process for managing changes and document revisions.

This document will serve as a comprehensive reference for the development team, ensuring that the "Online Faculty-Student Research Connection Platform" is successfully designed, built, and meets the needs of all stakeholders.

# 2. Requirements Specification

This section specifies the software product's requirements. Specify all of the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a software system to satisfy those requirements, and to enable testers to test that the software system satisfies those requirements.

## 2.1 Customer, Users, and Stakeholders

A brief description of the customer, stakeholders, and users of your software.


----
## 2.2 Use Cases

This section will include the specification for your project in the form of use cases. The section should start with a short description of the actors involved (e.g., regular user, administrator, etc.) and then follow with a list of the use cases.

For each use case you should have the following:

* Name,
* Actors,
* Triggers (what initiates the use case),
* Preconditions (in what system state is this use case applicable),
* Actions (what actions will the code take to implement the use case),
* Alternative paths
* Postconditions (what is the system state after the use case is done),
* Acceptance tests (list one or more acceptance tests with concrete values for the parameters, and concrete assertions that you will make to verify the postconditions).

Each use case should also have a field called "Iteration" where you specify in which iteration you plan to implement this feature.

You may use the following table template for your use cases. Copy-paste this table for each use case you will include in your document.

| Use case # 1      |   |
| ------------------ |--|
| Name              | "enter your reponse here"  |
| Users             | "enter your reponse here"  |
| Rationale         | "enter your reponse here"  |
| Triggers          | "enter your reponse here"  |
| Preconditions     | "enter your reponse here"  |
| Actions           | "enter your reponse here"  |
| Alternative paths | "enter your reponse here"  |
| Postconditions    | "enter your reponse here"  |
| Acceptance tests  | "enter your reponse here"  |
| Iteration         | "enter your reponse here"  |

## 2.3 Non-Functional Requirements

List the non-functional requirements in this section.

You may use the following template for non-functional requirements.

1. [Enter a Concise Requirement Name]:  [provide a concise description, in clear and easily understandable language to specify the requirement]

----
# 3. User Interface

Here you should include the sketches or mockups for the main parts of the interface.

# 5. References

Cite your references here.

For the papers you cite give the authors, the title of the article, the journal name, journal volume number, date of publication and inclusive page numbers. Giving only the URL for the journal is not appropriate.

For the websites, give the title, author (if applicable) and the website URL.

# Appendix: Grading Rubric
(Please remove this part in your final submission)

These is the grading rubric that we will use to evaluate your document. 

| Max Points  | **Content** |
| ----------- | ------- |
| 10          | Do the requirements clearly state the customersâ€™ needs? |
| 5           | Do the requirements avoid specifying a design (note: customer-specified design elements are allowed; non-functional requirements may specify some major design requirements)? |
| | |  
|    | **Completeness** |
| 25 | Are use cases written in sufficient detail to allow for design and planning? |
| 4 | Do use cases have acceptance tests? | 
| 25 | Is your use case model complete? Are all major use cases included in the document? |
| 10 |  Are the User Interface Requirements given with some detail? Are there some sketches, mockups?  |
| | |  
|   | **Clarity** |
| 5 | Is the document carefully written, without typos and grammatical errors? |
| 4 | Is each part of the document in agreement with all other parts? |
|   | Are all items clear and not ambiguous? (Minor document readability issues should be handled off-line, not in the review, e.g. spelling, grammar, and organization). |
|   |   |
|    | **GitHub Issues** |
| 12 | Has the team setup their GitHub Issues page? Have they  generated the list of user stories, use-cases, created milestones, assigned use-cases (issues) to milestones?   Example GitHub repo (check the issues): https://github.com/WSU-CptS322-Fall2022/TermProjectSampleRepo/issues  |
